    <h1>Hello, I am Efe Baştuğ.</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am Efe Baştuğ. I am a 3rd year CENG student at Ankara Yildirim Beyazit 
        University (AYBÜ). I am interested in software development (surprising, 
        I know), writing short stories, mind games, video games, board games, card games
        (you could say any kind of game) and reading books. I have joined some writing
        competitions in the past, winning awards at some of them. <br>Either way, about my
        CENG career, I interned in two places: First, Türkiye Intelligence Foundation, 
        which taught me a lot about GUI implementation in Java, mind games and algorithms
        in general, and second, in Hacettepe University, which was about web development.
        Currently, I am a candidate engineer (I guess it is an accurate translation) at
        ROKETSAN, doing systems engineering.
    </p>
